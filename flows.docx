Certainly! To implement your requirement for sending email alerts based on specific conditions in Salesforce using Flows, you'll need to set up a scheduled flow. This flow will check records daily and send email alerts based on the criteria you specified:

1. **Income_Type__c equals 'Rent'**
2. **Status__c equals 'Pending'**
3. **Due_Date__c conditions**:
   - Greater than 3 days from today
   - Equals today
   - Less than today (for overdue)

### Step 1: Prepare Email Templates

Before creating the Flow, ensure you have the necessary email templates set up in Salesforce for each scenario:

1. **Navigate to Setup** in Salesforce.
2. Search for **Email Templates** in the Quick Find box.
3. Choose **Email Templates** under Email.
4. Create new email templates for each of your alert scenarios (due in more than 3 days, due today, and past due).

### Step 2: Create a New Scheduled Flow

1. **Go to Setup** and enter **Flows** in the Quick Find box.
2. Click **Flows** and then **New Flow**.
3. Select **Scheduled Flow** as the flow type, which is used for executing the flow at specified times.

### Step 3: Configure the Flow Trigger

1. Set the flow to start running on a schedule that makes sense for your requirements (e.g., every day at 1 AM).
2. Define the frequency and specify the start date and time.

### Step 4: Add Flow Elements for Record Query

1. Drag a **Get Records** element onto the canvas.
2. Configure it to query `Income__c` records where:
   - **Income_Type__c** equals 'Rent'
   - **Status__c** equals 'Pending'
   - You'll add date criteria in decision elements later.

### Step 5: Add Decision Elements

1. **Add a Decision element** after your Get Records element to branch based on the `Due_Date__c`.
2. Configure outcomes for:
   - **Due in More Than 3 Days**: `Due_Date__c` is greater than `Formula for Today + 3 days`.
   - **Due Today**: `Due_Date__c` equals `Formula for Today`.
   - **Past Due**: `Due_Date__c` is less than `Formula for Today`.

### Step 6: Set Up Email Alerts

1. For each path in the Decision element, add an **Action element** to send an email.
2. Select the appropriate email template for each scenario.
3. Specify the recipient as the record owner or any other relevant party.

### Step 7: Save and Activate the Flow

1. Give your flow a name and a description.
2. Save the flow and then click **Activate** to make it live.

### Step 8: Testing and Monitoring

1. Test the flow by setting up test records that meet each condition.
2. Monitor the scheduled runs in the **Scheduled Jobs** section under Setup to ensure the flow executes as expected.
3. Check the email outputs to confirm that the correct templates are being sent under the right conditions.

### Notes:

- **Variables and Formulas**: You may need to use variables and formulas to calculate dates. Salesforce Flow allows you to create formula variables to dynamically calculate dates based on `Today()`.
- **Debugging**: Salesforce provides debugging tools within the Flow Builder to test your logic with example records before activation.

By following these steps, you can set up a comprehensive scheduled flow in Salesforce that monitors Income records and sends automated email alerts based on your specified criteria, ensuring timely notifications related to rent statuses.
